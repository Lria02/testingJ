            <p>Jason is a Criminology Student at X university, 
                and he doesn't like boba tea, his house has 
                a lot of gardening and flowers, he even has a little
                old-timey like Victorian style.<br><br>
                
                He likes girls
                and wants a girlfriend but
                he doesn't even have female friends because
                he is shy and awkward around them. He thought they were
                uncomfortable just being around him.... or at least that's what he thinks.
                In reality, girls think that he is very
                tidy and well-reserved, easy to get along
                with especially when talking about
                his hobbies which are animes.<br><br>
                
                There was a time
                that he played Camelot, an anime collection discord
                bot where he whaled hard. During the time he was playing
                he liked bullying other players by dueling them (asking them
                for arena battles). Sooner the dev of Camelot started
                recruiting players to become helpers or mods. There he met
                a player that he got close with, this player later on sent a Cosplay
                Picture with his friend in an Anime Convention there.... started everything.
                Since then, Jason asked that friend for a new cosplay picture every day.
                This madness lasted for hundreds of days.
                Just like staying as a v*rgin at 30 years old to be a mage, Jason gained
                an Achievement for his unwavering commitment, his huge determination to get that
                cosplay picture. Because of this Achievement, he gained an ability
                perfect for his Assiduous Nature. Bro is down bad for a cosplay picture
                that he gained an ability to call a waifu to help him in any situation. However, Jason
                is too much of a simp for a waifu so he cannot hit any female
                or even a male if they crossdress as a waifu.
