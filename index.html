            <p>Jason is a Criminology Student at X university, 
                and he doesn't like boba tea, his has house have 
                a lot of gardening and flowers, he even have a little
                old timey like victorian style.<br><br>
                
                He likes girls
                and want a girlfriend but
                he don't even have female friends because
                he is shy and awkward around them he thought they he is
                making the girls uncomfortable just him being around them....
                or at least that's what he think.
                In reality, girls think that he is very
                tidy and well reserved, easy to get along
                with especially when talking about
                his hobbies which are animes.<br><br>
                
                There was a time
                that he play Camelot, an anime collection discord
                bot where he whaled hard, during the time he was playing
                he likes bullying other player by dueling them(asking them
                for arena battle). Sooner the dev of Camelot started
                recruiting player to become a helper or mod, there he met
                a player that he got close with, this player later on send a Cosplay
                Picture with his friend in an Anime Convention there.... started everything.
                since then, Jason ask that friend for a new cosplay picture everyday
                this madness lasted for hundreds of days.
                just like staying as a v*rgin at 30 years old to be a mage, Jason gain
                an Achievement for his unwavering commitment, his huge determination to get that
                cosplay picture. Because of this Achievements he gain an ability
                perfect for his Assiduous Nature, Bro is down bad for a cosplay picture
                that he gain an ability to call a waifu to help him in any situation. However, Jason
                is too much of a simp for a waifu so he cannot hit any Female
                or even a male if they crossdress as a waifu.
